# codedex

### the journey begins... ðŸ‘¾

over the past couple of years while i've been in school,
i took it upon myself to learn a new language.
sure, i liked JavaScript and the different libraries i got to work with,
and i definitely enjoyed learning and working with c# as well,
but i wanted a new challenge.
i was looking at different documentation to learn python,
then in the midst of my searching, i came across codedex.

i've done my fair share of gaming in the past.
i TRY to fit that into my schedule if i have the time to,
but haven't really got that gaming fix out of my system.
what a life-saver codedex has been!
i have been on the journey and learning path for python,
(not so consistently)
over the past 2 years and plan on continuing through.

here, i am documenting and providing examples
of the code i create through the python learning path.
i am very excited to continue this journey and
truly hope to create some amazing projects from it!
thank you codedex team for the resources.
