# Q2) When I‚Äôm dead, I want people to remember me as:
#     1) The Good
#     2) The Great
#     3) The Wise

# If the answer is 1, Hufflepuff +2.
# Else if answer is 2, Slytherin +2.
# Else if answer is 3, Ravenclaw +2.
# Else if answer is 4, Gryffindor +2.
# Else, output the message "Wrong input."


# Q3) Which kind of instrument most pleases your ear?
#     1) The violin
