# Create a dry.py program and check out the complete list of built-in functions:

# Find 4 built-in functions that we have used previously in the course.
# Pick 1 built-in function that we have not seen before.
# Use each of these once in the program.

# For the new function, try to read the documentation (😵‍💫) or Google it (👍)!

# Add a comment for each built-in function to explain how they work.

# known built-ins --------------------------------------------------

# Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end. 
# sep, end, file, and flush, if present, must be given as keyword arguments
print('jelly bean')

# Return the length (the number of items) of an object. 
# The argument may be a sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) 
# or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set)
print(len('jelly bean'))

# Represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping 
# a specific number of times in for loops
print(list(range(1, 11)))

# This function calculates the maximum of two numbers
print(max(1, 10))

# haven't seen before ---------------------------------------------

# Returns a boolean value (true/false)
x = bool(2)
print(x)
