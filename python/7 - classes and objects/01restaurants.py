# Create a Restaurant class in a restaurants.py file with the following attributes:

# .name of the type str
# .category of the type str
# .rating of the type float
# .delivery of the type bool
# Make these empty/default values for now.

# Nothing should happen when you run the code, because we have yet to use this class. 
# In the next exercise, we will start using it!
