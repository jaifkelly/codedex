# It's time to open up a bank account! üè¶

# Create a file called bank_accounts.py.

# Let's define a BankAccount class. 
# Then, let's use the __init__() method to set the following attributes:

# first_name (string)
# last_name (string)
# account_id (integer)
# account_type (string)
# pin (integer)
# balance (float)
# Next, let's create three methods:

# .deposit(): Add money into the account and return the new balance.
# .withdraw(): Take money out by subtracting from balance and returning the withdrawn amount.
# .display_balance(): Print the current value of balance.
# Lastly, initialize a new object from the BankAccount class 
# and use these methods to do the following:

# Deposit $96 in the account.
# Withdraw $25 from the account.
# Print the current account balance.

class BankAccount:
  def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, account_id, account_type, pin, balance):
    self.first_name = first_name
    self.last_name = last_name
    self.account_id = account_id
    self.account_type = account_type
    self.pin = pin 
    self.balance = balance

  def deposit(self, amount):
    self.balance += amount
    return self.balance

  def withdraw(self, amount):
    self.balance -= amount
    return self.balance

  def display_balance(self):
    print(f"${self.balance}")

checking_account.deposit(96)
