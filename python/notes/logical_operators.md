Logical operators, also known as Boolean operators, combine and evaluate two conditions.
They are and, or, and not operators:

'and' returns True if both conditions are True, and returns False otherwise.
'or' returns True if at least one of the conditions is True, and False otherwise.
'not' returns True if the condition is False, and vice versa.
